## Phones classification based on a price range
This project was created as a homework for major "Applied statistical analysis" - course "Classification of statistical Data". Here were used some methods:
- discriminant analysis (with and without assumption on equal covariation matrix);
- decision tree
- random forest
The results were visualized.

The data used was downloaded from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification]
